# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Agent Scrivener is an autonomous research and content synthesis platform that transforms a single research query into a comprehensive, structured, and fully-cited research document. The system orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to automate the entire lifecycle of knowledge work, from information discovery and analysis to content synthesis and citation management.

The platform addresses the critical challenge of building complex multi-agent systems by leveraging Kiro's spec-driven development methodology to manage inter-agent communication, data contracts, and system orchestration without falling into the typical pitfalls of distributed AI systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Research Query Processing

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to submit a single high-level research query so that the system can autonomously generate a comprehensive research document without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a research query THEN the system SHALL accept queries of at least 500 characters in length
2. WHEN a query is received THEN the system SHALL validate the query format and return an error for invalid inputs
3. WHEN a valid query is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a unique session ID for tracking the research process
4. WHEN query processing begins THEN the system SHALL return an estimated completion time to the user

### Requirement 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the platform to coordinate multiple specialized agents so that complex research tasks are broken down into manageable, specialized workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a research query THEN the Planner Agent SHALL decompose the request into a structured task graph
2. WHEN task decomposition is complete THEN the system SHALL dispatch tasks to appropriate specialist agents based on task type
3. WHEN an agent completes a task THEN the system SHALL update the task graph and trigger dependent tasks
4. WHEN all tasks are complete THEN the system SHALL aggregate results from all agents into a final output

### Requirement 3: Web Research Capabilities

**User Story:** As a research agent, I want to autonomously browse and extract information from web sources so that I can gather comprehensive data on any research topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Research Agent receives a search task THEN it SHALL perform web searches and identify the top 10 most relevant URLs
2. WHEN a relevant URL is identified THEN the agent SHALL navigate to the webpage and extract clean article content
3. WHEN content extraction is complete THEN the agent SHALL return structured data containing extracted text and source metadata
4. WHEN web navigation encounters errors THEN the agent SHALL retry up to 3 times before marking the source as unavailable

### Requirement 4: Academic Database Integration

**User Story:** As an API Agent, I want to query structured academic databases so that I can retrieve precise, well-formatted scholarly data to complement web research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Agent receives a database query THEN it SHALL search relevant academic databases (arXiv, PubMed, Semantic Scholar)
2. WHEN database results are retrieved THEN the agent SHALL return structured data including titles, authors, abstracts, and publication metadata
3. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the agent SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN database queries fail THEN the agent SHALL log errors and continue with available data sources

### Requirement 5: Data Analysis and Synthesis

**User Story:** As an Analysis Agent, I want to process raw research data to identify key themes and insights so that the final report contains meaningful analysis rather than just raw information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Analysis Agent receives raw research data THEN it SHALL perform named entity recognition to identify key concepts
2. WHEN text analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL generate topic models to uncover latent themes
3. WHEN numerical data is present THEN the agent SHALL perform statistical analysis and generate visualizations
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL return structured insights with confidence scores

### Requirement 6: Content Generation and Formatting

**User Story:** As a Drafting Agent, I want to synthesize analyzed research into coherent prose so that the final output reads as a professional research document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Drafting Agent receives structured insights THEN it SHALL generate coherent sections including introduction, methodology, findings, and conclusion
2. WHEN content generation is complete THEN the document SHALL maintain consistent tone and logical flow throughout
3. WHEN formatting the document THEN the agent SHALL use proper Markdown formatting with headers, lists, and emphasis
4. WHEN the draft is complete THEN it SHALL include a table of contents with proper section linking

### Requirement 7: Citation Management and Verification

**User Story:** As a Citation Agent, I want to trace and format all source references so that the final document maintains academic rigor and intellectual integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other agents process information THEN the Citation Agent SHALL track the provenance of every fact and quote
2. WHEN source tracking is complete THEN the agent SHALL format citations in consistent bibliographic style (APA format)
3. WHEN the final document is generated THEN all in-text citations SHALL have corresponding entries in the references section
4. WHEN citation verification runs THEN the agent SHALL validate that all URLs are accessible and metadata is accurate

### Requirement 8: System State Management and Memory

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the platform to maintain context across long research sessions so that complex research projects can be built incrementally over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research session begins THEN the system SHALL maintain short-term memory for the current session context
2. WHEN research findings are generated THEN the system SHALL store synthesized insights in long-term memory
3. WHEN a user returns to a previous research topic THEN the system SHALL retrieve and build upon previous findings
4. WHEN memory storage reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent pruning of older, less relevant data

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and System Resilience

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to handle failures gracefully so that partial research failures don't compromise the entire research process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an individual agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL isolate the failure and continue with other agents
2. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs for debugging
3. WHEN network timeouts happen THEN agents SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN it SHALL resume processing from the last successful checkpoint

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to handle multiple concurrent research requests so that it can serve multiple users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple research requests are submitted THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently without interference
2. WHEN system load increases THEN the platform SHALL scale agent instances automatically
3. WHEN research tasks are long-running THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates to users
4. WHEN resource usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent task queuing and prioritization
